# B2 — Index Engine: rebuild qmd on SQLite

> **The engine design — the *how*.** Evaluates rebuilding [tobi/qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) on
> our own SQLite store (FTS5 + an in-process vector scan, reranker as a fast follow) instead of
> adopting qmd as a dependency, and specifies the result. Companion design docs:
> [invariants.md](invariants.md) (the *why*) and [data-model.md](data-model.md) (the *what*); semantic
> search is **engine-gated**, single-binary, local-first.

## TL;DR / recommendation

**Build our own SQLite-backed index engine; take qmd as a design reference, not a dependency.**

- qmd is an excellent *blueprint* for hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vector + RRF + LLM rerank) and proves
  the whole pipeline runs locally. But it is a **search engine**, and B2 is not — B2 is a **typed graph
  with hybrid retrieval over it**. qmd has no notion of typed edges, backlinks, or `b2id`-stable identity,
  which are the reasons B2 exists ([invariants.md](invariants.md)).
- SQLite gives us **one embedded store for every *queryable* concern at once** — full-text (FTS5),
  vectors (plain tables scored in-process), and the typed graph — with transactional consistency across them, so
  `b2 similar` candidate generation joins all three in a single query. That single-store property is
  worth more to B2 than anything we'd inherit by depending on qmd. The index is a pure **disposable
  cache**: `index = projection of (the vault directory)` — drop it, reindex, get it back identical,
  with **no durable B2-derived state outside your notes** (two tiers, [data-model.md](data-model.md)).
- Because the engine **does** provide vector search, the locked **engine-gated** decision resolves in
  favour of **semantic search in v1**, not as a fast follow ([invariants.md](invariants.md)).
- The **reranker is a clean fast-follow**: a swappable seam after RRF fusion, exactly as the testability
  stack wants the AI parts isolated. Retrieval quality is good without it; it's pure upside later.
- The one genuinely hard part is **not the engine** — it's **producing embeddings inside a single
  binary** ([invariants.md](invariants.md)). qmd solves this with
  `node-llama-cpp` + GGUF + Node 22, a heavy stack that fights the single-binary goal. This is the real
  decision to make, and it is **orthogonal to choosing SQLite** (see §7).

---

## 1. What qmd actually is (the reference)

A local CLI search engine for Markdown, all on-device. The shape worth stealing:

- **Storage:** SQLite at `~/.cache/qmd/index.sqlite` with FTS5 + `sqlite-vec`. Tables: `collections`,
  `path_contexts`, `documents`, `documents_fts` (FTS5/BM25), `content_vectors` (chunk metadata),
  `vectors_vec` (`sqlite-vec` index), `llm_cache`.
- **Chunking:** ~900-token chunks, ~15% overlap, Markdown-aware break-point scoring (H1=100, H2=90,
  code-fence=80, … blank-line=20, list-item=5), with a 200-token backward scan and quadratic distance
  decay to pick the cleanest boundary. Optional tree-sitter AST chunking for code files.
  **Implemented in B2** (`chunk.rs`, #19, 2026-07-13),
  with four model-free adaptations: a **~450**-token target (headroom under bge's 512 truncation), a
  `chars/4` proxy for token sizing (the core stays tokenizer-free), an unconditional `heading_path`
  breadcrumb, and every lever on a `ChunkConfig`. Tree-sitter code chunking stays deferred (#41 / spec §8).
- **Three search modes:** `search` (BM25 only), `vsearch` (vector only), `query` (hybrid).
- **Hybrid pipeline (`query`):** LLM query expansion (1–2 variants, original weighted 2×) → parallel
  BM25 + vector retrieval per variant → **RRF fusion** (`Σ 1/(k+rank+1)`, k=60) + small top-rank
  bonuses → keep top 30 → **LLM rerank** (cross-encoder, 0–1) → **position-aware blend** (top ranks
  trust retrieval more, deep ranks trust the reranker more).
- **Models (local GGUF via `node-llama-cpp`):** EmbeddingGemma-300M (embed, ~300 MB),
  Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B (rerank, ~640 MB), a fine-tuned 1.7B (query expansion, ~1.1 GB). ~2–3 GB VRAM
  with all three loaded.
- **Surfaces:** rich CLI, JSON/CSV/files output for agents, an **MCP server** (stdio + HTTP daemon),
  and a TypeScript SDK (`createStore`).
- **Stack:** TypeScript on Node 22+/Bun; MIT licensed.

It's a clean, well-thought-out design. The disagreement is **scope**, not quality.

## 2. Why we rebuild instead of depend on qmd

| Concern | qmd | B2's need |
|---|---|---|
| Full-text search | ✅ FTS5/BM25 | ✅ same |
| Semantic search | ✅ `sqlite-vec` | ✅ in-process scan |
| Rerank | ✅ cross-encoder | ✅ fast-follow |
| **Typed graph** (`b2id→b2id` edges with a relation type) | ❌ none | ⭐ core (areas 3, 5) |
| **Backlinks** (who points at X, typed, over the whole vault) | ❌ none | ⭐ core (area 5) |
| **`b2id`-keyed identity** surviving move/rename | ❌ path-keyed, cache is disposable | ⭐ core (invariants L1) |
| **Markdown as source of truth** (index is rebuildable/derived) | ~ index *is* the artifact | ⭐ non-negotiable (principle #1) |
| Distribution | npm package, Node runtime | ⭐ single binary (principle #5) |

The decisive point: B2's index is a **derived projection of the vault** that holds the **typed graph**
*next to* the search indexes, so retrieval and connection discovery share one transactional store —
`index = projection of (the vault directory)`, drop-and-rebuild at any time ([data-model.md](data-model.md)). qmd
models none of the graph layer — wrapping it would mean maintaining a second store for everything that
makes B2 *B2*, and reconciling two sources of truth. Rebuilding the ~300 lines of retrieval glue that we
actually want is cheaper than that integration tax — and qmd's MIT license + public design make the
rebuild low-risk.

**What we borrow wholesale:** the chunking heuristic, the RRF formula and k, the position-aware blend,
the asymmetric query/document prompt discipline (each model brings its own prefix — B2 ships bge's, §6;
not EmbeddingGemma's `task:…|query:` / `title:…|text:`), the JSON/`--explain`
agent-output discipline, and the MCP surface idea. **What we discard:** the npm/Node packaging and the
"DB is the product" framing.

## 3. The storage architecture (one disposable SQLite index)

One artifact, per the two-tier model ([data-model.md](data-model.md)) and realizing the **"volatile vault
over a disposable index"** tenet ([invariants.md](invariants.md)): a
**disposable** SQLite index holding every queryable concern transactionally. The whole index is
**rebuildable from the vault** — drop `b2.sqlite`, re-scan the vault, get back an identical index (the
locked `full-reindex ≡ incremental-update` invariant). The vault is the single source of truth (with
Markdown its sole authored subset — notes + every committed edge); the index is a cache of it, with
**no durable B2-derived state outside your notes**.

> The precise DDL, the relations between these tables, the read/write data flows, and the build order
> are realized in the code (`crates/b2-core/src/db.rs` schema + `ingest.rs` flows). The sketch below is
> the orientation; the code is the buildable contract.

```
b2.sqlite — DISPOSABLE CACHE  (= projection of Markdown; drop & rebuild any time)
├── MIRROR OF MARKDOWN (source of truth for *knowledge*; lets us diff vs. disk)
│   ├── notes(b2id PK, path, title, type, frontmatter_json, body_hash, mtime, …)  -- b2id ← frontmatter

```

Every table is derived from the vault; there is no third home.
*(The projection is built in two separately-invokable passes —
model-free `project` (notes/chunks/FTS/edges) then `embed` (vectors), with `reindex` their
composition — so keyword search + graph are usable before embedding completes;
the `project`/`embed` split ([#15](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/15)). The invariant is untouched:
a projected-but-unembedded index is a smaller projection, never a wrong one.)*

**Resources widen the projection.** A real vault also holds non-`.md` files, and the walk inventories
them. The locked
design ([data-model.md](data-model.md) §10, [#66](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/66))
adds them as **path-keyed peers** without disturbing any statement above — the source *tier* is the
whole vault directory, so **`index = projection of (the vault directory)`**:

- **A `resources` table** — `(path PK, class, size, mtime, content_hash, indexed_at)` — a **separate**
  table from `notes`, not a `kind` column on it (two tables, two contracts, zero "unless it's a resource"
  clauses). Class is by **extension only** (deterministic; misclassification degrades, never mis-executes):
  `note` · `text` · `html` · `pdf` · `image` · `media` · `binary` (the total fallback), each answering the
  same three questions — what index text, can it be a graph endpoint, how does it render.
- **`chunks` generalizes** from `note_b2id` to a **document reference** (a note `b2id` *or* a resource
  path — as one-of nullable FKs on the single table, CASCADE intact for both parents; locked,
  [#66](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/66)); search resolves hits up to the
  owning document and results carry a `kind`. **Centroids follow** — two-stage discovery's coarse stage
  scans only centroids (#38, §4 update), so a resource with chunks but no centroid would be searchable yet
  invisible to `b2 similar`; a sibling `resource_centroids` table (same locked call) is maintained through
  the existing lifecycle (embed-pass refresh, re-chunk drop) and the coarse stage scans both. Every
  class funnels to *text* — native, extracted (`html` strip / `pdf` text layer), or, for an `image`,
  aggregated inbound alt-text — embedded through the **existing** bge space: one embedding space in v1,
  the multimodal seam documented for later (§6 posture, [data-model.md](data-model.md) §10).
- **`edges.dst` may be a resource** — a body `![[photo.png]]` / `[[papers/x.pdf]]` resolves against
  `resources` and records a `dst_resource_path`; `src` stays a note (resources author no outbound edges in
  v1). The existing `dst_path_raw` + dangling-edge index (`db.rs`) is already half of this; the `link.rs`
  parser learns the two Markdown-native forms `![alt](path)` / `[text](path)` (relative paths only) and the
  `![[file.ext]]` embed, capturing the alt/caption text on the edge (it becomes the image's index text).
- **No migration, ever.** Because the index is disposable this is a `schema_version` bump + rebuild — the
  disposable-index tenet paying rent. The `resources` DDL lands in the **slice-1 build spec**
  ([#65](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/65)); the chunk/centroid generalization and the per-class extraction step land in
  slice 3's; the PDF text-extraction *dependency* (which crate, and its home) is deferred to slice 4 by
  design.

Why this shape fits B2 specifically:

- **Edges key on `b2id`, never path** — directly implements the link-identity decision
  ([data-model.md](data-model.md) §1). `notes.b2id` is the durable
  frontmatter identity (B2's one always-allowed write); `src_id`/`dst_id` and `note_b2id` all hold
  `b2id` values. A move rewrites `notes.path` and inbound `[[path|title]]` text; every row in `edges`
  is untouched because it never referenced the path. "Rename keeps every backlink resolving" becomes a
  foreign-key truth, not a fix-up pass.
- **Every `edges` row derives from Markdown** — body links (`origin=inline`, all untyped `references`) ∪
  frontmatter `b2_relations:` (`origin=frontmatter`, the sole typed home), deduped frontmatter-wins on
  same-`(target, type)` overlap. There is **no `status` column and no suggestion queue**: an edge exists
  iff it is authored in the Markdown. Committing with **`b2 link`** appends a typed-link
  string to the source note's frontmatter `b2_relations:` (Markdown first; never the body —
  [data-model.md](data-model.md) §0), then re-projects that note — a projection of an authored line, not
  an in-place index write.
- **Hybrid retrieval and graph queries compose in one query** — e.g. "semantic-nearest chunks whose
  note is within 2 typed hops of note X" is a join across `embeddings`, `chunks`, and `edges`. This is
  the substrate **`b2 similar`** (connection-discovery candidate generation) runs on, and it's the thing a
  qmd-as-dependency design could never give us cleanly.
- **Deterministic seams for tests** — a fake embedder (deterministic vectors) writes to `embeddings`, so
  the whole pipeline is assertable with no live model (testability stack, points 4–5). The embedder is the
  one AI seam.

### Opening the index concurrently — many readers, one builder

Nothing in B2 opens the index exclusively, and several things open it at once: `b2 reindex &` racing a
`b2 status`, the desktop app launching while a CLI reindex runs, the desktop host's own threads. The
locked stance is **C1** ([invariants.md](invariants.md)) — unrestricted readers, a serialized builder —
and `db::open` is where it is enforced, in three layers that each answer a different failure:

- **The `WAL` flip is retried** ([#111](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/111)). Setting
  `journal_mode = WAL` is the one statement in `open` that takes a write lock, and the one
  `busy_timeout` cannot cover (SQLite skips the busy handler for a write lock upgraded from an already-open
  read transaction), so a second opener took an immediate `SQLITE_BUSY`. The wait is ours to do.
- **The schema migration is one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction, entered only when there is work**
  ([#114](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/114)). It is a read-then-decide-then-write sequence,
  and its rebuild is ~30 DDL statements; unserialized, two openers that both read a stale
  `schema_version` interleave — one's `DROP TABLE resources` landing after the other's `CREATE`, and the
  current version stamped over a half-demolished schema. `busy_timeout` was irrelevant: nothing contended
  for a lock, every statement succeeded, in the wrong order. Serializing on SQLite's own write lock makes
  the loser wait and then find the work done; wrapping it makes a rebuild all-or-nothing, which is what
  lets the stamp be trusted. The check that decides whether to enter is a **read** — so the common open,
  against a current schema, takes no write lock and can never be refused by a writer.
- **Completeness is checked, not assumed.** A stamp is believed only alongside the tables it vouches
  for; a current stamp over missing tables (the wreckage a pre-#114 `b2` could leave) is treated as stale
  and rebuilt from empty. Recreating just the missing tables would be worse than useless: an incremental
  reindex skips notes whose `body_hash` matches, so the recreated tables would stay empty and `S3`
  (`full-reindex ≡ incremental-update`) would quietly fail.

The vector tables (created at embed time, §4/M4) are the same drop-and-rebuild shape and get the same
treatment — two embed passes can genuinely overlap, since the `reindex` advisory lock
([#55](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/55)) is taken by `b2-cli` alone and never by the desktop
host or by readers.

**Why not an advisory lock file for this**, given B2 already has one for `reindex`? Because it would be a
*third* concurrency mechanism guarding state the database already knows how to guard, and the weaker one
where it counts: a vault on a network share or a synced folder — a plausible home for a personal vault —
is exactly where `flock` quietly stops meaning anything. The `reindex` lock answers a question SQLite
cannot (*is another **process** already doing this expensive work?*); schema atomicity is not that
question.

### Why materialize the graph at all — vs. resolving links at runtime

A note's *outbound* links (and their type + explanation) are parseable from that one file on demand, so
it's fair to ask why the index carries an `edges` table at all rather than resolving links at read time.
The answer separates two things the question tends to bundle. **Edge metadata is *not* the reason:** a
`b2_relations:` entry `"supports [[path|title]] — because X"` yields its verb and explanation to a
runtime parse just as well, *for that note's outbound edges*. **Inversion and composition are the reason.** Materializing
edges is what turns the following from full-vault scans (or impossibilities) into indexed lookups:

- **Backlinks / inversion.** "Who points at X" cannot be read from X — only from every *other* note.
  The runtime answer is O(vault) per query; the table makes it one lookup. This is also what services
  *"rename keeps every backlink resolving"* ([invariants.md](invariants.md) L1): the edges name
  the exact N inbound files to rewrite on a move instead of scanning the vault to find them (§8).
- **Typed multi-hop traversal.** "notes within 2 hops of X via `supports`/`contradicts`" is a scan *per hop*
  at runtime; over `edges` it is one SQL traversal.
- **The graph⨝vector join.** "semantic-nearest chunks whose note is within k typed hops of X" is a single
  join `embeddings ⨝ chunks ⨝ edges`, not expressible as a per-note parse. It is a **scoped-traversal**
  primitive (search *within* an already-related neighborhood). **`b2 similar`'s candidate generation is its
  *complement*, not this join:** notes semantically near an anchor but *not* within 1 hop — the links you
  *haven't* made (resolved 2026-07-01, §3) — where the materialized graph supplies
  the "∖ already-connected" exclusion. Both stand on the same reason the graph and search indexes must live
  in **one** store (§2): area-5 discovery is the substrate this enables.

The reframe that keeps this cheap: **runtime outbound-parsing is the correctness *definition*
(`index = projection of Markdown`); the `edges` table is its *cache*, kept so the inverse and compositional
queries are fast.** It is therefore not a third subsystem beside FTS5 and the vector tables — it is one more
**disposable** table in the same store, populated by the **same parse pass** that already walks each body
for chunking. Strip it and B2 is vector + keyword search over Markdown — i.e. qmd (§2); the typed,
traversable graph is the value-add, not the search. The standing cost of carrying it is the
`b2id`-under-`[[path]]` write-amplification budgeted in §8.

FTS5 is built into SQLite (BM25 ranking included); vectors need no extension — plain tables scored
in-process ([#38](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/38)). Both are
battle-tested at personal-vault scale.

## 4. Semantic search & the engine-gated decision → verdict

The locked decision: *"if the index engine provides vector/semantic search, it's in v1."*

The engine provides it. Therefore **semantic search is in v1.**

How it runs — an **exact, in-process scan**, no vector extension, no ANN:

- **Storage & scoring:** vectors live in plain tables — `embeddings(chunk_id, vector)` plus per-note
  `note_centroids` — read with one sequential statement and scored in-process (`embed::l2_sq`). A
  `vec0`-style virtual table charges a per-row shadow-table probe on every scan, which dominates at
  real-vault scale; the plain-table scan does not. Full analysis + options:
  [#38](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/38).
- **Discovery is two-stage:** an O(notes) coarse scan over centroids shortlists candidates, then an
  exact max-sim rescore over only the shortlist's chunk vectors.
- **Does brute force scale to B2?** Yes, comfortably. A personal vault of, say, 10k notes → ~50–100k
  chunks. Brute-force cosine over ~100k × 768-dim float32 vectors is on the order of **single-digit to
  low-tens of milliseconds** — well within an interactive budget. We're nowhere near the regime
  where ANN matters; if a vault ever is (multi-hundred-k chunks), int8/binary quantization and ANN
  hold a standby order behind the centroid stage.

So: **semantic search ships in v1**, exact KNN, 768-dim float vectors, with quantization in our
back pocket. This is the headline consequence of choosing SQLite.

## 5. The reranker as a fast follow

Slot it exactly where qmd puts it: **after RRF fusion, before final ranking**, behind a swappable seam.

- v1: retrieve (BM25 + vector) → **RRF fusion** → return top-N. This is already good; RRF alone is a
  strong hybrid baseline.
- Fast follow: insert a **cross-encoder rerank** over the top ~30 candidates → position-aware blend.
  The reranker is a pure function `(query, candidates) → scores`; the seam is the same one the
  testability stack wants for AI parts (replay recorded scores as fixtures; quality measured in a
  separate eval suite, never in CI).
- This is why the reranker is genuinely deferrable with no architectural debt: it changes *ordering*,
  not the store, the schema, or the candidate set. "Eventually add a reranker" is a one-stage insertion,
  not a redesign. It is also **store-agnostic** — a model-side seam above the index, not a property of it,
  so no vector-store choice simplifies or blocks it ([#67](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/67)).

**Scope — this reranks `b2 search`, not `b2 similar`.** The seam signature `(query, candidates) → scores`
is the tell: it needs *query text*, so it reorders **query search** (`b2 search`). **`b2 similar` has no
query** — it is passage↔passage KNN, "near ∖ connected" (§3) — so this reranker
does **not** apply to it; the discovery-side ranking levers are the qmd chunker upgrade
([#19](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/19)) and distance-weighting
([#20](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/20)), not this.

**Gate the decision on the eval, not intuition** (the eval harness under `crates/b2-embed/evals/`). RRF
is a strong baseline; the reranker buys **top-k precision**, whose value *grows with vault size* (semantic
near-misses crowd the top past ~1k notes) and is *highest when an agent consumes top-1/top-3 without a
human eye* (the `serve` adapter, [#24](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/24)). Vault size changes
whether the precision is *worth* it, not the reranker's cost — that is fixed at the top-N it rescores. So
measure RRF precision@k / MRR on a representative set first and ship the reranker only on a measured gap;
this is the deferral §5 is built to allow. Tracked in [#28](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/28).

Query expansion (qmd's third model, the fine-tuned 1.7B) is **optional and lowest priority** — it's the
heaviest model for the smallest, most variable win. Treat it as a later, off-by-default flag.

## 6. The real hard part: embeddings in a single binary

This is the only place the architecture meets real friction, and it's worth being honest that **it is
independent of the SQLite decision** — any engine that does semantic search needs vectors from
somewhere.

qmd's answer is `node-llama-cpp` + auto-downloaded GGUF models + Node 22/Bun, needing ~300 MB–3 GB of
model files and a JS runtime. That directly tensions B2's single-binary, no-install-ritual goal
([invariants.md](invariants.md)). Options, roughly in order of single-binary
friendliness:

1. **Bundle a small embedding model + a `llama.cpp`/GGUF runtime, statically linked.** Self-contained,
   fully offline, but the binary carries a few-hundred-MB model (or downloads it on first run — a
   one-time ritual, not a per-use one). EmbeddingGemma-300M or Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B are the candidates.
2. **`fastembed` / ONNX Runtime** with a small embedding model — mature, embeddable, good language
   bindings (Rust/Go/Python); similar size tradeoff, arguably cleaner than carrying a full LLM runtime
   just to embed.
3. **Pluggable embedder behind a seam, default local + optional remote API.** B2 already wants the
   embedder swappable (deterministic fake for tests). Ship local-by-default; allow an API embedder for
   users who opt in. Keeps the binary tiny; preserves local-first as the default.

**Recommendation:** make the **embedder a seam** (we need it for tests regardless — and a swappable
model seam *is* the **"build for tomorrow's model"** tenet in practice,
[invariants.md](invariants.md)), ship a **local model as the default**
(option 1 or 2), and decide model-download-on-first-run vs. bundled-in-binary as a packaging detail
later. Crucially, **none of this blocks the engine work**: build the SQLite store +
FTS5 + the vector tables + the typed graph now against the deterministic fake embedder; drop the real
embedder into the seam when the packaging path is chosen.

**Decided (2026-06-30).** Runtime = **`candle` + `hf-hub`** (pure-Rust inference compiled into the
binary — no external ONNX Runtime to ship; `hf-hub` is the download seam). Model =
**EmbeddingGemma-300M @ dim 768** (fallback to a known-good candle embedding model if it proves fiddly).
**Not bundled** — an explicit **`b2 init`** downloads + verifies the model into a shared **XDG cache**
(`~/.local/share/b2/models/`), never a surprise mid-command download; `reindex`/`search` fail fast with
"run `b2 init`" if it's absent. **The model source is configurable** (default = an HF repo id;
overridable to a mirror, another repo, or a local path for offline installs) via a global TOML at
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/config.toml`. Build/execution plan tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues).

**Built (2026-07-01).** Shipped in the **`b2-embed`** crate (`LocalEmbedder` behind the `b2-core`
`Embedder` seam; candle + `hf-hub`; CLS-pool + L2-normalize; asymmetric query prefix). **Model default
changed to `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`** (BERT-family, **768-dim**, ungated): EmbeddingGemma-300M is *gated*
on Hugging Face (HTTP 401 without a token + license acceptance), which defeats a friction-free `b2 init`
— so B2 ships the pre-authorized bge fallback by default, validated in the spike (cat↔feline 0.83; NL
queries retrieve by meaning, not keyword). EmbeddingGemma remains selectable via config for anyone who
provides a token. The dim is read authoritatively from the model's own `config.json` (`hidden_size`), so
config can't lie about it. `open()` no longer shapes/drops the vector space (the mismatch fails fast on
`search`, re-embeds on `reindex`); the fake embedder stays the CI default so model quality never enters
the fast suite. Eval is a `cargo run -p b2-embed --example eval` pass (precision/MRR), out of CI.

## 7. Tech-stack implications — resolved: Rust

- **SQLite + FTS5 are language-agnostic** (strong embedded bindings for Rust, Go, Python, Node), so
  the engine didn't pick the language; the **single-binary goal** did — it favours a compiled
  language, and B2 is a **Rust Cargo workspace** (`rusqlite` with bundled SQLite; `candle` for the
  embedder).
- qmd's TypeScript/Node path is the *least* aligned with principle #5, which is another reason not to
  inherit qmd's runtime by depending on it.

## 8. Risks, open questions & operational burden

### Engine risks & open questions

- **Embedding model size vs. single binary** (§6) — **resolved:** not bundled; an explicit
  `b2 init` downloads a configurable model (candle + hf-hub) into a shared XDG cache. The binary stays small.
- **Embedding dimension & model lock-in.** Changing the embed model means re-embedding the whole vault.
  **Locked:** the embedding space is **dim 768** — the default **`BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`** and the
  config-selectable EmbeddingGemma-300M are both 768-dim (§6); a model/dim change is a
  full re-embed, detected via `meta` — fail fast on read, re-embed on `reindex`.
- **Chunk vs. note granularity for the graph.** Search is chunk-level; the typed graph is note-level.
  Keep `chunks.note_b2id` as the join and resolve search hits up to notes for graph operations — already
  reflected in §3.

### Operational burden — the bill for a `b2id`-keyed graph under `[[path|title]]` links

The graph buys B2 its reason to exist (typed, `b2id`-stable edges — §2), but the decision to
keep links written as human-clickable `[[path|title]]` while the graph keys on `b2id`
([data-model.md](data-model.md) §9) has standing operational costs. These are
*the trade working as designed*, not defects — but they must be budgeted, tested, and watched.

- **Write amplification on move.** The inline `path` is a repairable convenience copy, so moving one note
  rewrites the inbound link text in **every** file that points at it — an N-file write, not a one-file
  write. It's bounded and mechanical (the `b2id`-keyed edges name exactly which files/links to touch,
  Markdown-first then index), but moving a heavily-linked note is proportional to its backlink count, not
  O(1). Watch the cost on hub notes; keep the rewrite transactional so a partial move never half-updates
  the vault.
- **Out-of-band moves degrade gracefully, not perfectly.** A `git mv`/Finder move + reindex re-reads the
  frontmatter `b2id` and re-establishes `b2id → newpath`, repairing dangling inbound links — **if** there is
  prior index continuity. A **cold reindex with no prior state** can only repair a dangling `[[oldpath]]`
  heuristically (e.g. via the alias); those links are **flagged for repair, not silently dropped**. This
  is the same failure surface as moving files with Obsidian closed — acceptable, but it means the index is
  load-bearing for full repair fidelity.
- **Path ownership follows the Markdown, and a reindex never aborts on it.** `notes.path` is unique, but a
  path can change hands out of band — a note deleted then recreated at the same path, or files renamed/
  swapped outside `b2 mv` so a path now belongs to a different `b2id`. Projection reconciles to the current
  truth: `db::upsert_note` drops the **stale** row that still holds the path (its chunks/edges cascade)
  before writing the new owner, so an incremental reindex converges on the same state as a from-scratch
  rebuild (`full-reindex ≡ incremental-update`) instead of failing on a raw `UNIQUE(notes.path)` error.
  A note file *deleted with no replacement* is reconciled by the whole-vault projection pass
  ([#31](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/31)): `project_vault` prunes every `notes` row whose
  `b2id` it did not project this run (`db::prune_notes_except` — chunks/FTS/vectors/outgoing edges
  cascade; inbound links re-dangle when phase 2 re-derives edges against the pruned resolver), **except**
  rows whose file was skipped as unreadable — the walk saw that file, its `b2id` is merely unknowable this
  run, so evicting it would lie. Single-note ingest (`add`/`mv`/`write`) touches one note and never
  prunes. *(Resources churn more than notes — images/PDFs get added and deleted freely — and their
  inventory pass prunes the same way; [#66](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/66).)*
- **Duplicate `b2id`s resolve incumbent-wins and are surfaced, never guessed at**
  ([#81](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/81)). Two files presenting one id (a Finder
  duplicate) has no well-defined projection, and no vault-pure signal distinguishes original from
  copy — a copy preserves every byte, and `note copy.md` even *sorts before* `note.md`, so any
  walk-order or path-order rule would hand the identity to the copy. The projection pass therefore
  pre-scans claims and resolves each contested id **before any row is written**: the **incumbent**
  (the path the index already attributes the id to, when that file still claims it) keeps the
  identity — the one confident signal, and it lives in index memory, which is why this is a
  documented carve-out on S3 ([invariants.md](invariants.md)); a memory-less rebuild tie-breaks
  first-in-sorted-walk, *flagged as a tie-break, not a ruling*. Shadowed claimants stay on disk
  but get **no row** — and therefore no presence in the file tree either, which lists notes from
  the index (`list_notes`); only folders are read live off the filesystem. That is what makes the
  notice the *only* way a human learns the copy exists, and why the desktop's review panel offers
  a shadowed path for copying rather than a reveal that could not resolve
  ([#88](https://github.com/AlteredCraft/B2/issues/88)). The collision is reported (`collisions` on
  the reindex/project reports, with kept path + precedence + shadowed paths) on **every pass until
  resolved**: delete the copy; or remove its `b2id:` line (the next pass stamps a fresh identity —
  the documented fork gesture); or delete the original (the copy then inherits the identity through
  the ordinary move repointing). Single-note ingest through `ingest_file` (the `add`/`mv`/`link`
  path) **refuses** an identity steal outright (`Error::B2idCollision`) when the incumbent still
  exists and still claims the id; `project_file` (the in-app save path — `write`/`create_note`)
  deliberately does not guard, since refusing after the bytes hit disk would strand the index
  stale — the whole-vault pass owns reconciling and surfacing that state. The same pass
  also surfaces **identity restamps** (`restamped`): a file whose `b2id:` line was removed/blanked
  out-of-band reads as absent (#75), so the stamp mints a fresh id — identity churn that dangles
  every inbound edge keyed to the old id (G5 keeps surfacing those). Deliberately **not**
  auto-restored: removing the line is also the documented gesture for *requesting* a fresh identity,
  so restoring the old id would guess intent. Nothing anomaly-shaped is ever stored — every notice
  re-derives from vault + index each pass (S2), and `reindex --dry-run` previews all of it read-only
  (which notes lack a `b2id`, which stamps would churn an identity, which files collide).
- **A single unreadable file never fails the whole index.** A real vault holds the odd non-UTF-8 or
  permission-denied `.md`; projection **skips** it (reported as a `skipped` entry carrying a short,
  file-level reason, surfaced by the CLI and the desktop) and indexes everything else, rather than aborting
  the reindex on one file it cannot read.
- **Derived-index consistency is a permanent invariant, not a one-time build.** The index is a derived
  projection of `Markdown` and must never drift from it. Three locked invariants are the tripwires
  (the full register: [invariants.md](invariants.md)):
  round-trip losslessness (`parse → serialize → parse`),
  `full-reindex ≡ incremental-update`, and `rename keeps every backlink resolving`. Every edit path
  (kernel `b2 mv`, link delete, out-of-band reindex) has to preserve all three or the graph silently
  diverges from the source of truth.
- **Committed edges are only ever authored, never inferred.** B2 writes an edge only on your command
  (`b2 link`, or a body link you write) — there is no agent proposing edges and no review queue to keep
  consistent. Editing the vault can strand a connection — e.g. deleting an authored `A→B` link
  ([invariants.md](invariants.md) W4) — but B2 only ever *surfaces* the consequence (an orphan
  flag in `b2 explain`), never silently rewrites an inbound file or an edge. Files are touched only when asked.

## 9. Recommendation

1. **SQLite is the B2 index engine** (FTS5 + plain vector tables) per the §3 schema — one disposable
   index, `index = projection of (the vault directory)`. qmd is a design reference under its MIT
   license, **not** a dependency.
2. **The engine-gated outcome:** semantic search is **in v1** (exact in-process KNN; quantization
   reserved for scale).
3. **Reranker = explicit fast-follow** behind a post-fusion seam; query expansion = later/optional.
4. **The embedder is a seam**; the store + indexes + typed graph are built and tested against the
   **deterministic fake embedder**, with the golden-vault fixtures as the yardstick
   ([data-model.md](data-model.md) §8).
